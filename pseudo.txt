     Create a console game of rock paper scissors;
     Console randomly chooses between rock, paper, or scissors {
         choice made through math.random,
         if the result is less than or equal to 0.3333 then computer is equal to Rock,
         if the result is less than or equal to 0.6666 then result is equal to Paper,
         if the result is greater than 0.6666 then the result is equal to Scissors,
     }
     user enters rock, paper or scissors;
     compare user result with console;
     Emit one of the 3 options{
         User Won
         User Lost
         User Tied
     }
     The values are as follows {
         Rock > Scissors;
         Paper > Rock;
         Scissors > Paper;
         Rock === Rock;
         Paper === Paper;

           I need to make a function called playGame in which the playRound function lives inside it,
    I need to play 5 rounds by invoking the playRound function 5 times
    in each round I update the variables userScore or computerScore depending on the result
